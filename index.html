			<h2 style="color: red;" ><b>Introduction to web Development</b></h2>
                         <br><br><h3 style="color: white;">Web development is the work involved in developing a Web site for the Internet (World Wide Web) or an intranet (a private network). Web development can range from developing a simple single static page of plain text to complex Web-based Internet applications (Web apps), electronic businesses, and social network services. 
  		   <p>Web development is the building and maintenance of websites; itâ€™s the work that happens behind the scenes to make a website look great, work fast and perform well with a seamless user experience.<br>

     <p><em>HTML is the standard markup language for creating Web pages.<br>
Hypertext Markup Language (HTML) is the standard markup language for documents designed to be displayed in a web browser. 
It can be assisted by technologies such as Cascading Style Sheets (CSS) and scripting languages such as JavaScript.
Web browsers receive HTML documents from a web server or from local storage and render the documents into multimedia web pages. 
HTML describes the structure of a web page semantically and originally included cues for the appearance of the document.
HTML elements are the building blocks of HTML pages. With HTML constructs, images and other objects such as interactive forms may be embedded into the rendered page. 
HTML provides a means to create structured documents by denoting structural semantics for text such as headings, paragraphs, lists, links, quotes and other items. 
HTML elements are delineated by tags, written using angle brackets.

     <p>Cascading Style Sheets (CSS) is a style sheet language used for describing the presentation of a document written in a markup language such as HTML.
CSS is a cornerstone technology of the World Wide Web, alongside HTML and JavaScript.<br>
<p>CSS is designed to enable the separation of presentation and content, including layout, colors, and fonts.
This separation can improve content accessibility, provide more flexibility and control in the specification of 
presentation characteristics, enable multiple web pages to share formatting by specifying the relevant CSS in a 
separate .css file which reduces complexity and repetition in the structural content as well as 
enabling the .css file to be cached to improve the page load speed between the pages that share the file and its formatting.
<br>
<p>Separation of formatting and content also makes it feasible to present the same markup page in different styles 
for different rendering methods, such as on-screen, in print, by voice (via speech-based browser or screen reader), 
and on Braille-based tactile devices. 
CSS also has rules for alternate formatting if the content is accessed on a mobile device.<br>
<h4 style="color: red;">Advantages of CSS<br>
<p><b>1.CSS saves time<br>2.Pages load faster<br>3.Easy maintenance<br>4.Superior styles to HTML<br>5.Multiple Device Compatibility<br>6.Global web standards.</b>

     <p>JavaScript,often abbreviated as JS, is a programming language that conforms to the ECMAScript specification.
 JavaScript is high-level, often just-in-time compiled, and multi-paradigm. It has curly-bracket 
syntax, dynamic typing, prototype-based object-orientation, and first-class functions.
<p>Alongside HTML and CSS, JavaScript is one of the core technologies of the World Wide Web.
JavaScript enables interactive web pages and is an essential part of web applications. 
The vast majority of websites use it for client-side page behavior,and all major web browsers have a dedicated 
JavaScript engine to execute it.<br>
As a multi-paradigm language, JavaScript supports event-driven, functional, and imperative programming styles. 
It has application programming interfaces (APIs) for working with text, dates, regular expressions, 
standard data structures, and the Document Object Model (DOM). However, the language itself does not include any input/output (I/O), 
such as networking, storage, or graphics facilities, as the host environment (usually a web browser) provides those APIs.<br><br>
